# DownloadAccelerator

This Java program is meant to accelerate the download of a file received from a server. At first the server splits the file to be sent into
specific parts and sends it to the client and then the client the merges the sent pieces into a single file again which accelerates the whole
process of sending and receiving a file using a TCP.
