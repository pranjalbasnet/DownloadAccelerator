#FileSpliiter

This Java program is especially meant to split a given file into a specific number of files of almost equal sizes. The use of FileInputStream
and FileOutputStream makes it easier to work with the files and the program tries its best to make equal partitions and in case of extra bytes,
it manages to use that extra byte into the final file made.
